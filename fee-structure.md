# Fee Structure

NFT generation fee formula is (cost of generation x 3). The cost includes LLM AI cost, Image generation AI cost, hosting services and server, BNB Greenfield storage costs, operator transaction and minting costs and similar technical costs.

The fees will be paid by BNB until the launch of STRY token and will continue with STRY token. As the cost of generation relies on services of USD price, the fee will be kept pegged to USD cost of generation.

Economic model aligns with a three-part division of fees among the team/investors, the community/users, and covering costs. This provides a clear structure for revenue distribution.

1. Community/Users (1/3 of Story Fee):

* Rationale: Encourages community engagement and rewards users who hold NFTs, fostering a sense of ownership and loyalty.
* Implementation: Distribute 1/3 of the story creation fee proportionally to NFT holders. This can be calculated based on the percentage of total NFT ownership.

2. Investors (1/3 of Story Fee):

* Rationale: Recognizes the efforts of the team and provides a return on investment for early investors.
* Implementation: Automatic allocation of 1/3 of the story creation fee to a fund designated for the team and investors.

3. Costs (1/3 of Story Fee):

* Rationale: Ensures sustainability and covers ongoing operational costs, including fixed costs, AI expenses, and hosting.
* Implementation: Direct allocation of 1/3 of the story creation fee to cover all associated costs.
