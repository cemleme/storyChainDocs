# About StoryChain

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/71KWtbX2xQg" %}

StoryChain is an interactive storytelling platform where you create characters, build their lore, and bring them to life through AI chat. Users can explore open-ended conversations or play goal-oriented scenarios with clear objectives. Achievements are rewarded with badges (many mintable as NFTs), and creators earn when the community engages with their characters.



**Core Pillars**

* Storytelling: Build rich character backstories, worlds, and narratives that evolve with community input.
* Character Creation: Design unique characters with images, personalities, and lore. Convert them into interactive chat agents.
* Animation & Visuals: Unlock story arcs, animations, and world backgrounds as you create and grow your universe.
* Chat Systems: Offer two experiences; open-ended exploration and scenario-based challenges with objectives and limited turns.
* Creator Economy: Earn a share of the paid Energy used when others interact with your characters.



**How It Works**

1. **Create Your Character**

* Define a compelling backstory, personality, and visual identity.
* Make your character “chattable” so others can interact with it.

2. **Choose the Chat Experience**

* Open-Ended Exploration: Free-form conversations rooted in your character’s lore.
* Goal-Oriented Challenges: Scenario-based stories with specific objectives, limited turns, and badge rewards.

3. **Discover and Play**

* Explore characters via discovery filters (all, official, community, my).
* Jump into scenarios with clear goals and earn badges upon completion.

4. **Collect, Compete, Improve**

* Earn badges (and mint badge NFTs) for completing objectives.
* Track progress and rankings via leaderboards (badges, messages, characters).
* Iterate on your characters using analytics and community feedback.



**Earning on StoryChain**

* Energy Economy: Interactions (chat, hints, mints, scenarios) consume Energy.
* Revenue Share: 30% of all paid Energy spent on your character is shared directly with you.
* Analytics Dashboard: Monitor withdrawable balance, total monetized Energy, messages, likes, mints, and more.
* Withdrawals: Claim your earnings once you meet the minimum threshold (e.g., $0.20). Payout requests are processed shortly after submitting.
* Getting Paid: Connect your wallet, grow your character’s audience, and earn as the community engages.&#x20;

**What StoryChain Solves**

* Recognition and Attribution: Creators need clear, persistent attribution for their characters and contributions.
* Monetization Gap: Traditional storytelling platforms rarely provide a path to meaningful, recurring earnings tied to engagement.
