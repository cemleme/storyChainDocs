The six-step process for creating a Story NFT, from prompt approval to on-chain storage, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient experience:



1. Approving Prompt:

A light- large language model checks the prompt safety and suitability and reject if not.

2. Language AI Processing:

A cutting edge large language model analyzes the title and the prompt and writes a story and also a prompt for image generation

3. Image AI Processing:

The selected Image AI model generates the image

4. Preparing NFT Metadata:

The system prepares NFT metadata including the story text and the image

5. Minting NFT:

The operator sends the transaction on chain

6. Saving On Chain:
