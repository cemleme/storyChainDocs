# Blockchains and Cross Chain

StoryChain will initially be deployed on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) for its launch phase. Following this, the platform plans to expand its reach by integrating with various Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains for cross-chain functionality.

StoryChain's debut on the Binance Smart Chain provides users with a seamless and efficient experience, leveraging the high throughput and low transaction fees offered by BSC. The STRY token, serving as the investment and governance token, will be released and listed on the Binance Smart Chain. Users can participate in investment activities and governance processes directly on the BSC network.

In line with the project's vision for interoperability and broader accessibility, StoryChain aims to implement cross-chain functionality, enabling users to interact with the platform across multiple EVM-compatible chains. This strategic expansion will enhance user engagement, and overall ecosystem growth, ensuring StoryChain's presence in diverse blockchain ecosystems.

Through cross-chain integration, users will have the flexibility to engage with StoryChain's features and tokens on their preferred blockchain network, further decentralizing access and fostering a more inclusive and interconnected storytelling community.
