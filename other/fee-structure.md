# Fee Structure

NFT generation cost includes LLM AI cost, Image generation AI cost, hosting services and server, BNB Greenfield storage costs, operator transaction and minting costs and similar technical costs.

The generation fees will be paid by BNB until the launch of STRY token and will continue with STRY token. As the cost of generation relies on services of USD price, the fee will be kept pegged to USD cost of generation.

Economic model aligns with a three-part division of fees among the community/users, the treasury and covering costs. This provides a clear structure for revenue distribution.



1. A portion of the fee is divided among Community/Users:

* Rationale: Encourages community engagement and rewards users who hold NFTs, fostering a sense of ownership and loyalty.
* Implementation: Distribute the portion of the story creation fee proportionally to NFT holders. This can be calculated based on the percentage of total NFT ownership.

2. A portion of the fee is given to the treasury:

* Rationale: Recognizes the efforts of the team and allows further development.
* Implementation: Automatic allocation of the portion of the story creation fee to a fund designated for the team.

3. Platform Costs:

* Rationale: Ensures sustainability and covers ongoing operational costs, including fixed costs, AI expenses, and hosting.
* Implementation: Direct allocation of the portion of the story creation fee to cover all associated costs.
