# What is StoryChain Chat?

StoryChain Chat is where your characters come alive.&#x20;

It blends storytelling, AI, and game-like objectives so you can:

* Chat freely with AI-powered characters grounded in rich lore
* Take on goal-oriented scenarios with specific objectives and limited turns
* Earn badges for achievements (many are mintable as collectibles)
* Compete and discover through leaderboards and character discovery

## Why it matters

* **For players**: It turns conversation into an interactive adventure; explore story worlds, solve challenges, and build a badge collection.
* **For creators**: Your characters become interactive agents. As the community engages, you earn from their activity via the Energy economy.

## Core concepts

* **Characters**: AI-enabled identities with backstories, traits, and visuals. You can create your own or explore the community's.
* **Scenarios**: Structured, goal-driven chat experiences with clear objectives and limited turns.
* **Energy**: The in-app currency spent on interactions like chat, hints, mints, and scenarios.
* **Badges**: Rewards earned by completing scenarios; many can be minted as collectibles.
* **Leaderboards**: Community rankings for badges earned, messages, and character metrics.
* **Personal Chat History**: Continue your conversations anytime from where you left off.

## Two ways to chat

### Open-Ended Exploration

* Free-form conversations rooted in each character's narrative.
* Great for immersion, roleplay, and world-building.

### Scenarios with Objectives

* Short, goal-oriented challenges with a target objective and limited turns.
* Complete scenarios to earn badges and mint eligible badges as collectibles.
