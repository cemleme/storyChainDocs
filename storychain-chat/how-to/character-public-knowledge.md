## What You'll Learn

Discover how to give your AI characters consistent memory, history, or expertise using StoryChain's Public Knowledge feature. This powerful tool ensures your characters always know specific information across all their chats and scenarios.

### Understanding Public Knowledge

Character public knowledge is perfect for:

* **Fictional or real-world knowledge** that your character should always possess
* **Backstory details** that aren't included in the main description
* **Technical knowledge** about specific projects or domains
* **Secret information** about other characters or plot elements
* **Fixed details** that should remain consistent across all interactions

### Step-by-Step Process Covered:

1. **Identifying Knowledge Gaps**
   * Test your character by asking specific questions
   * Notice when answers are inconsistent or vague
   * Identify details that need to be fixed and consistent
2. **Adding Public Knowledge**
   * Edit your character settings
   * Navigate to the Public Knowledge section
   * Enter specific information (e.g., "Stationed at the Sunâ€“Earth Lagrange Point 2 (L2)")
   * Save the changes
3. **Testing the Implementation**
   * Start a fresh chat session
   * Ask the same questions that previously gave inconsistent answers
   * Verify that your character now provides consistent, accurate responses

## Key Features Covered

* **Public Knowledge Interface**: Navigate and use the knowledge management system
* **Consistency Testing**: Verify that knowledge is properly applied
* **Knowledge Scope**: Understand how public knowledge affects all scenarios
* **Best Practices**: Learn when to use character vs. scenario knowledge

## Important Distinctions

### Character Public Knowledge vs. Scenario Knowledge

* **Character Public Knowledge**: Applies to ALL scenarios that character appears in
* **Scenario Knowledge**: Only applies to specific scenarios

Use character public knowledge for:

* Core character traits and background
* Universal knowledge the character should always have
* Consistent personality elements

Use scenario knowledge for:

* Situation-specific information (like safe codes)
* Temporary plot elements
* Context that only applies to one story

## Best Practices

* Keep character public knowledge focused on essential, universal traits
* Test knowledge implementation with multiple chat sessions
* Use specific, clear language when defining knowledge
* Regularly review and update knowledge as your character evolves
* Consider the scope carefully - character knowledge affects ALL scenarios
