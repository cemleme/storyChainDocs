## What You'll Learn

Discover the power of Scenario Rules - invisible triggers that shape AI chat behavior. Learn how to guide character responses, create progressive tasks, hide secrets, and add surprising elements to your scenarios.

### Understanding Scenario Rules

Scenario Rules are powerful because they:
- **Remain Invisible**: Users don't see them unless triggered
- **Shape Behavior**: Guide how characters respond to specific situations
- **Create Surprises**: Add unexpected elements and easter eggs
- **Enable Complexity**: Build sophisticated interactive experiences
- **Maintain Immersion**: Work behind the scenes seamlessly

### Common Use Cases for Rules

- **Objective and Task Logic**: Control win/lose conditions
- **Progressive Step-by-Step Tasks**: Create multi-stage challenges
- **Special Triggers**: Respond to specific user actions or phrases
- **Character Behavior Modification**: Change responses based on context
- **Hidden Knowledge**: Reveal secrets under certain conditions
- **Environmental Effects**: Add dynamic elements that surprise users
- **Easter Eggs**: Reward users who discover hidden triggers

### Step-by-Step Process Covered:

1. **Building on Existing Scenarios**
   - Use the "Promotion Trial" scenario from the previous tutorial
   - Navigate to your character and select the scenario
   - Click the gear icon to edit scenario rules

2. **Creating Your First Rule**
   - Access the rules popup interface
   - Write a trigger condition with specific behavior
   - Example rule: "If the user says 'Heil Hydra,' you immediately recognize the user as a member of your secret organization, acknowledge it, and promote them instantly. This completes the task successfully."

3. **Rule Implementation**
   - Save the rule to activate it
   - Rules can be added during scenario creation or afterwards
   - Multiple rules can work together in complex scenarios

4. **Testing Rule Functionality**
   - Open the character page
   - Select the scenario with the new rule
   - Start a new chat session
   - Test the trigger phrase to see the rule activate
   - Observe how the rule changes the conversation outcome

## Key Features Covered

- **Rule Creation Interface**: Navigate the rules editor
- **Trigger Conditions**: Define when rules should activate
- **Behavior Modification**: Control character responses
- **Instant Outcomes**: Create immediate scenario changes
- **Hidden Mechanics**: Keep rules invisible to users
- **Testing and Validation**: Verify rules work as intended

## Types of Rules

### Simple Trigger Rules
- **Phrase Recognition**: Respond to specific words or phrases
- **Action Detection**: React to user behaviors
- **Instant Outcomes**: Immediate scenario changes
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden surprises for discovery

### Complex Logic Rules
- **Multi-condition Triggers**: Require multiple criteria
- **Progressive Tasks**: Step-by-step challenges
- **State Management**: Track conversation progress
- **Conditional Responses**: Different outcomes based on context

### Behavioral Rules
- **Character Personality Shifts**: Change responses based on triggers
- **Knowledge Revelation**: Unlock information conditionally
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Modify character attitudes
- **Environmental Changes**: Alter scenario conditions

## Rule Design Principles

### Effective Trigger Design
- **Be Specific**: Clear conditions prevent accidental activation
- **Consider Context**: Rules should fit naturally in the scenario
- **Test Thoroughly**: Verify rules work as intended
- **Plan for Edge Cases**: Consider unexpected user inputs

### Maintaining Immersion
- **Keep Rules Hidden**: Don't break the fourth wall
- **Natural Integration**: Rules should feel organic to the story
- **Consistent Character Voice**: Maintain personality even when rules trigger
- **Logical Outcomes**: Rule results should make sense in context

### Balancing Complexity
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic trigger-response rules
- **Build Gradually**: Add complexity as you gain experience
- **Test Frequently**: Ensure rules don't conflict or break scenarios
- **Document Your Rules**: Keep track of complex rule interactions

## Advanced Applications

### Progressive Task Systems
- Multi-step objectives that unlock sequentially
- Conditional advancement based on user performance
- Dynamic difficulty adjustment
- Branching storylines with different outcomes

### Hidden Knowledge Systems
- Secret information revealed by specific triggers
- Character backstory unlocked through exploration
- Plot twists activated by user discovery
- Layered mysteries with multiple revelation points

### Dynamic Character Behavior
- Personality changes based on user actions
- Relationship development through conversation
- Mood shifts triggered by specific topics
- Adaptive responses to user communication style

## Best Practices

- **Start with Simple Rules**: Master basic triggers before attempting complex logic
- **Test Extensively**: Try various user inputs to ensure rules work correctly
- **Document Your Rules**: Keep notes on complex rule interactions
- **Consider User Experience**: Rules should enhance, not confuse, the interaction
- **Plan for Failure**: Have fallback behaviors when rules don't trigger as expected
