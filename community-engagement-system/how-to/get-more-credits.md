_StoryChain generations run on credits—and getting them is simple!_

Head over to the **Credits** section on your **Settings** page. Here, you’ll see your **remaining credits** and have the option to **purchase more** whenever you need.

You can buy credits using **USDT** or **USDC**, and we support multiple networks for your convenience!

Once you select the amount of credits you’d like to purchase, you’ll need to **approve the contract**. You can choose to approve it **once** (which saves gas fees) or **approve it each time** you make a purchase.

After approval, just confirm the transaction in your wallet—and you’re all set! Your credits will be ready to use right away.
