# Create your own Mascot / Character

_With StoryChain, you can create a unique mascot or character to represent your project and guide your community’s collaborative generations!_\
This adds a fun, consistent element to all the stories created—through the same beloved character.

Here’s how to get started:\
1️⃣ Head to the **Mascots / Characters** section and click **Create Mascot**.\
2️⃣ Give your mascot a **name**, write a **description** of how you imagine them, and, if you like, add some **background information** to provide a common setting for the stories.\
3️⃣ Then, click **Generate Mascot**, and we’ll get to work!

🖼️ After a short wait, you’ll receive a **mascot suggestion**, complete with multiple expressions. You can either **approve it** or click **Regenerate** to see more options.

When reviewing suggestions, keep an eye out for:\
✅ Clear, non-blurry images\
✅ Consistency across the different expressions and poses\
✅ Exactly **four** expressions—no more, no less!

Once you find a set you love, click **Approve**.\
In this example, we’re curious to see more, so we’ll hit **Regenerate** and check out another option.

We’re happy with the second set, so we’ll go ahead and approve it!

🎉 From here, StoryChain takes care of the rest. We’ll start preparing your mascot’s data and begin training your **unique AI model**.\
This process can take **up to 20 minutes**—feel free to check back later, or hang tight until it’s ready.

Once training is complete, you’ll find your mascot listed under **Published Mascots**. You can now assign it to a **campaign** and start using it in your generations right away!
