# Assign your mascot / character to a campaign

_Now that your mascot or character is published, it’s time to put them to work!_

To do this, you’ll need to **assign your mascot to a campaign**. Here’s how:\
1️⃣ Head over to the **Campaigns** screen.\
2️⃣ You can either **edit an existing active campaign** and add your mascot there…\
👉 Or, you can **create a brand new campaign** and assign your mascot during setup.

Once assigned, your community’s generations will automatically use this mascot or character, keeping the stories fun, consistent, and connected. You can switch among campaigns to use different mascots.

💡 Want more flexibility? You can also choose **not to assign a mascot**, and your community can create freely—without a specific character guiding the way.
