_Managing generations for your community is super simple!_

Just head over to the **Generations** tab. Here, you can easily **enable** or **disable** generations with a quick toggle. Once enabled, your community can jump right in and start creating!

There are **three** generation methods you can activate:\
✅ **Web Generations**, which you can enable directly from the Web UI screen.\
✅ **Telegram Generations** and **Discord Generations**, which you’ll find in the **Groups** screen. We’ll show you how to add and enable them there!
