_Bring your project to life with a custom mascot or character on StoryChain!_

To get started, you’ll need a **Mascot Ticket**. Don’t worry—it’s easy!\
Just head over to the **Mascot** section and click **Buy Ticket**.

If you haven’t already, you’ll be prompted to **approve the contract** first. Once that’s done, go ahead and **purchase your ticket**. Confirm the transaction in your wallet, and the ticket will be added to your balance right away.

And that’s it! You’re now ready to create your very own mascot or character to represent your project and engage your community.
