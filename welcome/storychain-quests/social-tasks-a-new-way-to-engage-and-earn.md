**Swipe to Vote for Stories and Themes:** Engage with our content by swiping to vote on stories and themes. Your swipes help determine which content gets featured on the platform.

**Complete Quests to Earn Bonus Points:** Participate in quests to earn additional bonus points, boosting your earnings and enhancing your experience.

* **Connect Socials:** Link your social media accounts for a 10% boost on swipes. This integration not only increases your earnings but also helps grow the StoryChain community.
* **Invite Friends:** Invite friends and family to join StoryChain. You’ll receive a direct bonus and a boost multiplier based on your friends’ activity. The more active they are, the more you benefit.
* **Visit Daily:** Regular visits to the platform provide daily bonus points and increase your boost on swipes. Be consistent to maximize your rewards, as missing a day will reset your boost.
* **Level Up:** As you level up, you’ll unlock additional boosts and surprise gifts, offering more earning opportunities and exclusive rewards.
