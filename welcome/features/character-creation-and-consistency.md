**Character Consistency Across Stories:**\
One of the core principles of storytelling is maintaining character continuity. On StoryChain, once a user creates a character, it becomes the foundation for future stories. This ensures consistency and immersion, as users can bring their familiar characters into new adventures or storylines, creating a deeply engaging storytelling experience.

**Why It Matters:**

* Characters are central to any story. With consistent characters, creators can build deeper connections with their audience and establish memorable narratives.
* The feature not only helps maintain continuity but also makes it easier for creators to explore long-form or multi-part storytelling.
* These consistent avatars can also be used in other features like animated stickers and NFTs, giving users additional ways to showcase their creations.

Whether you're just starting your journey as a storyteller or expanding a series, StoryChain’s **Character Creation** feature empowers you to make your stories more relatable, consistent, and captivating.
